TerraLand now supports streaming scenes with runtime model placement (either procedural or geo-referenced) on android and iOS builds:

- While in android build settings as target platform, go to Player section in Project Settings and set "Write Permission"
	to External (SDCard) if your application needs to be installed on SD Card or change "Install Location" and "Write Permission"
	options based on your decision

- Make sure to add Nature/Terrain/Standard shader in Project Settings => Graphics => Always Included Shaders list and under
	Shader Stripping select Keep All in Instancing Variants drop down menu

- Make sure your device has enough space to build apps on it

- Create your server as you would normally do and place it somewhere on your hard drive

- In your scene, find RuntimeOffline script, type the name of the server directory which has been created by TerraLand Downloader
	(e.g. MyTerraLandServer_USA)

- On RuntimeOffline script, enable "Android Build" checkbox

- (Optional) Remove the component "Extended Fly Cam" on camera if existing and add "MobileTouchControls" script instead which is
	for mobile touch controls

- Build and run the scene on your device (You will receive errors regarding not found server directory at first run)

- Based on the setup in Project Settings whether if it is on Internal drive or SD Card and based on the "Package Name" in Player
	settings, a directory should be created under your phone's address: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<packagename>/files. In
	our case <packagename> is com.DefaultCompany.TerraLandAssetStore

- You should copy the server directory from your PC into the above path on your device. We used AirDroid to copy the server
	folder onto our android device (with write access on its settings)

- The final path on our phone is something like this:
	...\Android\data\com.DefaultCompany.TerraLandAssetStore\files\MyTerraLandServer_USA
	so that sub folders of "Elevation", "Imagery" & "Info" with all of their content are under this folder on device to be
	accessible by TerraLand's Streaming system

- Build the scene again without uninstalling the previous one and this time TerraLand can find the server on your device and will
	stream the tiles around camera while navigating the scene
